# readme 
This exercise will test your ability to read a data file and understand statistics about the data.

In later exercises, you will apply techniques to filter the data, build a machine learning model, and iteratively improve your model.

The course examples use data from Melbourne. To ensure you can apply these techniques on your own, you will have to apply them to a new dataset (with house prices from Iowa).

The exercises use a "notebook" coding environment.
